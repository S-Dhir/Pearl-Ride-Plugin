# Ender Pearl Ride plugin
## Description
Players that through Ender Pearls start riding them. 
Players are immune from suffocation, falling and flying into wall while they are riding an enderpearl.
Players can still be hit. A player that is hit, either by melee or projectile, will be ejected by the Ender Pearl. The Ender Pearl will continue flying. 
## Future planned features
### Commands
`/toggleEnable` - Enables/Disables plugin
`/deletePearls` - When a player throws an Ender Pearl while riding an Ender Pearl, what should happen to the Pearl that the player is riding?
### Crafting
Instead of the plugin completely modifying the way Ender Pearls work, I plan to add a completely new item that behaves in this way. ![Plan For future Crafting Recipe](https://github.com/S-Dhir/Pearl-Ride-Plugin/blob/main/FuturePlan.jpg?raw=true)

## Compiling yourself
The project was compiled manually using [Artifacts](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-artifacts.html#examples). The project does not use maven/gradle. 
Apart from SpigotAPI, CraftBukkit and Bukkit and their dependencies, there are no other dependencies. 
## Spigot page
The plugin is not ready yet to be published on Spigot. But you can download an early version from the releases page on the Github.
